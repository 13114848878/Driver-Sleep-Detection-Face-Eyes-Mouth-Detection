# Driver-Sleep-Detection-System
As part of my thesis project, I designed a monitoring system in Matlab which processes the video input to indicate the current driving aptitude of the driver and warning alarm is raised based on eye blink and mouth yawning rate if driver is fatigue. It is implemented using Viola-Jones and Sobel techniques for facial features detection.

Tools used:
MATLAB

ML Algorithms:
Viola-Jones Algo (MATLAB inbuilt)
Sobel Edge Detection (MATLAB inbuilt)

Output:
